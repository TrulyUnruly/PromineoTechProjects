What types of operations can you do in SQL (or specifically MySQL)?  List at least five (5) different statements that exist in MySQL? Give a brief description of what these do.

In MySQL you can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Some of the statements that can be used to accomplish these operations are: ALTER, CREATE, DROP, RENAME, INSERT, UPDATE, ROLLBACK, SET, CLONE just to name a few. 

ALTER - allows you to modify an existing database or table
CREATE - is used to create a new table in a database
DROP - will remove an entire table or individual columns or rows
RENAME - allows you to change the name of an existing table, columns or rows
INSERT - used when you need to add data into table
UPDATE - is used when modifying data and updating table to reflect those changes
ROLLBACK - will reverse changes made since last COMMIT in database
SET - used with UPDATE to specify values that should be updated in a table
CLONE - a snapshot of data stored in the database



What are wildcards in MySQL? How are they useful?  Give an example of a MySQL statement that could use wildcards.

A wildcard in MySQL is a character that is used to substitute for one or more characters in a string. The wildcards are the percent sign(%) and the underscore(_). Wildcards are useful when wanting to find a string that starts or ends with a specific character or multiple characters within a string, improves performance and saves time filtering records from a table. A '%' is used to represent 1 or multiple characters and '_' is used to represent a single character. Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator and the WHERE clause to find patterns in a clause. 

Example:
Return students who's major starts with 'M' -

SELECT * FROM students WHERE major LIKE 'M%';

-or-
Return students who's GPA is 3.0 or better -

SELECT * FROM students WHERE gpa LIKE '3.__'; 
(in the above example, there are 2 underscores to accommodate for 2 decimal places)
