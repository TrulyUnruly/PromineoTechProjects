What is JDBC?  What does it stand for?  How does it differ from or relate to MySQL?

A JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), allows applications to interact/connect with a relational database. Once connected, the application can execute queries and retrieve data from the database. MySQL relates to a JDBC in that MySQL is a type of relational database that the JDBC  provides a standard way to connect and interface with a database.


 What are the two method calls to execute a query in JDBC, and when do you use each?
 
The two methods for executing a query in JDBC are a Statement and a PreparedStatement.

The Statement in JDBC can execute queries without paramenters and is available in the Connection class.

The PreparedStatement in JDBC provides security for data by using parameters, preventing SQL injection attacks from unknown sources. PreparedStatement can be created by using prepareStatement() from connection class and take SQL query as String value.
